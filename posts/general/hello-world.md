### Hi there!

Looks like you found our brand-new blog!

<!--more-->

There's not much here yet, but the idea is to post status updates, release announcements, bughunt reports, and whatever else we feel like throwing up here! As we're still pre-1.0 (and pre roadmap, really!) the plan is a bit fuzzy, but feel free to check back here often to see what's up with this project. Additionally, you can always find info about the project's development on [github](https://github.com/emu-rs/rustual-boy) or our [development discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/65j9YMA).

And **yes**, we do support [rss](http://localhost:3000/rss)!

**Cheers, and hope you dig the blog!**
